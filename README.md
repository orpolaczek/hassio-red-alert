Notes to developers after forking or using the github template feature:

- When you merge to the 'main' branch of your repository a new build will be triggered.
  - Make sure you adjust the 'version' key in 'example/config.yaml' when you do that.
  - Make sure you update 'example/CHANGELOG.md' when you do that.
  - The first time this runs you might need to adjust the image configuration on github container registry to make it public
  - You may also need to adjust the github Actions configuration (Settings > Actions > General > Workflow > Read & Write)
- Adjust the 'image' key in 'example/config.yaml' so it points to your username instead of 'home-assistant'.
  - This is where the build images will be published to.
- Rename the example directory.
  - The 'slug' key in 'example/config.yaml' should match the directory name.
- Adjust all keys/url's that points to 'home-assistant' to now point to your user/fork.
- Share your repository on the forums https://community.home-assistant.io/c/projects/9
- Do awesome stuff!
